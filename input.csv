What are .c files used for in C programming?,".c files are source files in C that contain the actual code, including functions and program logic.",Embedded MTE325
What is the purpose of .h files in C?,".h files, or header files, typically contain declarations of functions, macros, and types (like structs) to be used in .c files.",Embedded MTE325
Define a function in the context of C programming.,"In C, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task, capable of taking input, processing it, and returning output.",Embedded MTE325
What are macros in C programming?,"Macros are a way to define reusable snippets or values using the #define directive, which the preprocessor replaces with their values or code snippets before compilation.",Embedded MTE325
What is a struct in C?,"A struct, or structure, is a user-defined data type in C that groups different types of variables under a single name, useful for creating complex data structures.",Embedded MTE325
What are pointers in C programming?,"Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable, allowing for dynamic memory allocation, efficient array handling, and creation of complex data structures.",Embedded MTE325
Give an example of a macro in C.,"An example of a macro in C could be #define PI 3.14159, which defines PI as a constant that can be reused in the code.",Embedded MTE325
Why are structs important in C?,"Structs are important for organizing complex data, representing objects or entities in a program, and for creating data structures like linked lists and trees.",Embedded MTE325
How do pointers enhance C programming?,"Pointers provide flexibility and power for dynamic memory management, manipulating arrays and strings, and handling complex data structures, which is crucial for efficient programming.",Embedded MTE325
