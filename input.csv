How would you define Machine Learning?,Machine learning is about building system that can learn from data and get better at a task.,ML HOML
Can you name four types of problems where it shines?,*Complex problems with no algorithmic solution *Replace a long list of hand tuned rules *Systems that adapt to fluctuating environments *To help humans learn,ML HOML
What is a labeled training set?,A data set which contains the desired solution,ML HOML
What are the two most common supervised tasks?,*Regression *Classification,ML HOML
What is regression used for?,When the output is continuous like the price of a house,ML HOML
What is classification used for?,,ML HOML
Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?,*Clustering *Visualization *Dimensionality reduction*Associate rule learning:,ML HOML
What is clustering used for?,Grouping the data based on similarities.,ML HOML
What is visualization used for?,Tries to maintain the structure of the data while visually revealing clusters and trends.,ML HOML
What is anomaly detection used for?,Detecting outliers or unusual behavior like credit card transactions,ML HOML
What is dimensionality reduction used for?,Simplify the data without loosing critical information,ML HOML
What is associate rule learning used for?,Tries to fund unexpected relationships between features,ML HOML
What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?,Reinforcement learning.,ML HOML
What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?,Unsupervised clustering algorithm if you don't know what clusters you want or a supervised classification algorithm if you do know.,ML HOML
Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?,Supervised learning problem.,ML HOML
What is an online learning system?,Is a system that can learn incrementally.,ML HOML
What are online learning systems used for,They can be used to: *Adapt to changing environments. *Train on very large quantities of data.,ML HOML
What is out-of-core learning?,This is then the model is trained on the data in steps because the whole data set is too large to fit in memory at one time. It used online learning techniques.,ML HOML
What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?,An instance-based learning system.,ML HOML
How does an instance based learning system make predictions?,"An instance-based learning system learns the training data by heart; then, when given a new instance, it uses a similarity measure to find the most similar learned instances and uses them to make predictions.",ML HOML
What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm’s hyperparameter?,"The hyperparameter is not trained, it is set at the beginning of training. It is a parameter of the learning algorithm itself, not the model.",ML HOML
What do model-based learning algorithms search for? ,Model-based learning algorithms search for an optimal value for the model parameters such that the model will generalize well to new instances.,ML HOML
What is the most common strategy model-based learning algorithms use to succeed?,"We usually train such systems by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized.",ML HOML
How do model-based learning algorithms make predictions?,"To make predictions, we feed the new instance’s features into the model’s prediction function, using the parameter values found by the learning algorithm.",ML HOML
Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?,*Insufficient data quantity *Non-representative training data *Poor quality data *Irrelevant features *Simple models that underfit the training data *Complex models that overfit the training data,ML HOML
"If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening?",This means that your model is likely overfitting the data.,ML HOML
What are three possible solutions to a model that is overfitting the data?,*Increase the amount of training data *Simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters *Reduce the noise in the training data,ML HOML
What is a test set and why would you want to use it?,"A test set is used to estimate the generalization error that a model will make on new instances, before the model is launched in production.",ML HOML
What is the purpose of a validation set?,A validation set is used to compare models. It makes it possible to select the best model and tune the hyperparameters.,ML HOML
What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?,If you tune you hyperparameters using only the test set then you risk overfitting the test set and the generalization error will be optimistic.,ML HOML
What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?,Cross-validation is a technique that makes it possible to compare models (for model selection and hyperparameter tuning) without the need for a separate vali‐ dation set. This saves precious training data.,ML HOML
